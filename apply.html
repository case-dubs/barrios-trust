          <h3>Primary Grant Consideration</h3>
          <p>Founded in Oakland in 1999, The Barrios Trust (TBT) provides support in the form of grants to youth-centered programs within our community.  We focus on programs that encourage healthy habits of mind and body, nourish cultural diversity and educate the whole child.  We prefer to support programs that integrate academic skills with enrichment activities in ways that help young people to develop skills, confidence and self-esteem and to reach their full potential.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="medium-12 large-12 columns">
          <h3>Other Considerations</h3>
          <p>TBT will make grants to organizations determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be 501(c)(3) qualifying organizations.  TBT will also award scholarships for individuals who fall within the spirit of TBTâ€™s mission.  Grants can be used for both operational expenses as well as capital acquisition.  Grants are made on an annual basis and applicants can reapply for grants, although TBT prefers not to make grants to any one organization for more than three consecutive years.</p>

        <div class="medium-12 large-12 columns">
          <h3>Geographic Area Served</h3>
          <p>Our grants are limited to the support of organizations and individuals in the greater Oakland Metropolitan area of Northern California.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="medium-12 large-12 columns">
          <h3>Grant Range</h3>
          <p>Our grants range between $1,000 and $25,000.  TBT prefers to make grants that provide no more than one-half of an organizations total budget in any twelve-month period.</p>
