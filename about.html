          <h3>Founder's Statement</h3>

          <p class="margin-top-20px">Growing up in Oakland during the Depression, I was deeply touched by the poverty and injustice I saw around me.  Although my parents had little money, they gave my brothers, my sisters and me a great deal of love and security and instilled in us a sense of confidence that we could overcome obstacles and be successful.</p>

          <p>Throughout my lifetime, I have recognized the importance of reaching out to others with a spirit of fellowship, to see their needs and to do what I could to help.  In 1999, my wife, Joanne, and I set up a non-profit organization to support young people who come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds in their educational pursuits.  Honoring the lineage of my mother, Louise Barrios Wilson, I named this new organization The Barrios Trust.</p>

          <p>I have taken great pride in being able to play a positive role in programs that provide opportunities for young people to develop self-confidence and embark upon positive paths that will impact their futures. It has been a special pleasure to have personal contact with the young people we support and to hear them talk about the unique ways in which these organizations and our support have affected them.</p>

          <p>In forming the Board of Trustees for The Barrios Trust I have drawn on family members and friends who identify with my philosophy and whose lives are enriched by the experience of being in a position to assist young people in fulfilling their potential.</p>

          <p>I have always believed that, in order to keep what you have, you have to be willing to give it away.  I have found that the more I have shared with others, the more abundance and material blessings have come back to me.  I believe that those of us to whom much has been given have a responsibility to give back to others who have not had the same good fortune.</p>

          <p>My hope is that those who have been touched by me, Joanne and The Barrios Trust will be able to appreciate the value of sharing with others out of a sense of love and fellowship and will give back to others when them have an opportunity to do so.</p>

          <p>The Barrios Trust has provided me with the opportunity to extend my values into the future.  I take satisfaction in knowing that the love, compassion and concern for others which I have tried to express during my lifetime will be continued beyond my lifespan through the good work of The Barrios Trust.</p>
